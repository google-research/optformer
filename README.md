# OptFormer: Transformer-based framework for Hyperparameter Optimization
This is the code used for the paper [Towards Learning Universal Hyperparameter Optimizers with Transformers (NeurIPS 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13320).

# Installation
To get started, manually install [T5X](https://github.com/google-research/t5x). Afterwards, install OptFormer with ``pip install -e .``.



# Usage

## Pre-trained OptFormer as a Policy ([Example Notebook](https://github.com/google-research/optformer/blob/main/optformer/notebooks/OptFormer_inference.ipynb))
To use our OptFormer pre-trained individually on public BBOB and HPO-B benchmarks, follow the steps:

1. (Optional) Download the model checkpoint from `gs://gresearch/optformer/model_checkpoints` for faster loading.
2. Load the model checkpoint into the `InferenceModel`, as shown in [policies_test.py](https://github.com/google-research/optformer/blob/main/optformer/t5x/policies.py).

The `InferenceModel` will then be wrapped into the `OptFormerDesigner`, which follows the same API as a OSS Vizier standard [`Designer`](https://oss-vizier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/developer/writing_algorithms.html).

## Training the OptFormer
To train an OptFormer model, the data will need to consist of a large collection of studies. This data may come from two sources:

1. Our training datasets generated from BBOB and HPO-B benchmarks. We provide cached T5X datasets in `gs://gresearch/optformer/datasets`. Those include one epoch of the training and evaluation datasets. BBOB datasets are generated with multiple hyperparameter optimization algorithms and the HPO-B dataset is generated with Google Vizier's GP-UCB algorithm. Additionally we provide 4 epochs and 30 epochs of cached BBOB and HPO-B training datasets respectively, each epoch using different data augmentations. Those are sufficient for training OptFormer for 100K steps with a batch size of 256. Training using this data converged to the model checkpoint found above.

2. Custom user-generated studies, which can be done using [OSS Vizier's benchmarking pipeline](https://oss-vizier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/index.html#for-benchmarking).

To train an OptFormer with the cached BBOB dataset, download datasets and run the following command to train a model locally (set your Jax platform properly).

```sh
PATH_TO_T5X_ROOT_DIR=...
PATH_TO_OPTFORMER_ROOT_DIR=...
PATH_TO_CACHED_DATASETS_ROOT_DIR=...
MODEL_DIR="/tmp/optformer/$(date +'%y%m%d%H%M%S')"
JAX_PLATFORMS='cpu' \
python3 ${PATH_TO_T5X_ROOT_DIR}/t5x/train.py \
  --seqio_additional_cache_dirs="$PATH_TO_CACHED_DATASETS_ROOT_DIR" \
  --gin_search_paths="${PATH_TO_OPTFORMER_ROOT_DIR}/optformer/optformer/t5x/configs" \
  --gin_file=runs/train.gin \
  --gin_file=tasks/bbob.gin \
  --gin.MODEL_DIR="'$MODEL_DIR'"
```

To use a smaller model size and batch size for debugging, change `t5x/examples/t5/t5_1_1/base.gin` to `t5x/examples/t5/t5_1_1/small.gin` in the task gin file `tasks/bbob.gin` and override the `BATCH_SIZE` as follows

```sh
JAX_PLATFORMS='cpu' \
python3 ${PATH_TO_T5X_ROOT_DIR}/t5x/train.py \
  --seqio_additional_cache_dirs="$PATH_TO_CACHED_DATASETS_ROOT_DIR" \
  --gin_search_paths="${PATH_TO_OPTFORMER_ROOT_DIR}/optformer/optformer/t5x/configs" \
  --gin_file=runs/train.gin \
  --gin_file=tasks/bbob.gin \
  --gin.MODEL_DIR="'$MODEL_DIR'" \
  --gin.BATCH_SIZE=8 \
```

You can also launch a training job with xmanager:

```sh
GOOGLE_CLOUD_BUCKET_NAME=...
PATH_TO_T5X_ROOT_DIR=...
PATH_TO_OPTFORMER_ROOT_DIR=...
MODEL_DIR=gs://$GOOGLE_CLOUD_BUCKET_NAME/optformer/$(date +'%y%m%d%H%M%S')
python3 PATH_TO_T5X_ROOT_DIR/t5x/scripts/xm_launch.py \
  --extra_args="seqio_additional_cache_dirs=gs://gresearch/optformer/datasets" \
  --gin_search_paths=${PATH_TO_OPTFORMER_ROOT_DIR}/optformer/optformer/t5x/configs \
  --gin_file=runs/train.gin \
  --gin_file=tasks/bbob.gin \
  --model_dir=$MODEL_DIR
```
